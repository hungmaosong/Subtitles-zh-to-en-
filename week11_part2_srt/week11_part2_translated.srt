1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,200
Then let's go next

2
00:00:02,966 --> 00:00:03,833
Next

3
00:00:05,466 --> 00:00:07,000
Continue here

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:08,900
This is back to the one just now

5
00:00:10,266 --> 00:00:15,100
The r1, r2, r3 I just talked about

6
00:00:16,466 --> 00:00:18,600
3 scratchpads

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:20,700
After we just talked about register sharing

8
00:00:20,700 --> 00:00:23,100
Only 3 scratchpads are used

9
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,266
Then you pay attention

10
00:00:24,266 --> 00:00:27,266
I still have a lot of computing units here

11
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:30,333
So the functional unit sharing we just talked about

12
00:00:30,333 --> 00:00:32,733
that is

13
00:00:32,733 --> 00:00:34,100
Someone asked you to say

14
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,766
Those computing units are shared by them

15
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:38,866
you have a way to

16
00:00:38,866 --> 00:00:41,866
Are the computing units below shared?

17
00:00:41,866 --> 00:00:42,966
that is

18
00:00:43,166 --> 00:00:46,766
I can do it together

19
00:00:46,766 --> 00:00:48,166
You have to think like this

20
00:00:48,533 --> 00:00:50,666
I'm going to make this today

21
00:00:50,666 --> 00:00:52,166
No, this is the absolute value

22
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,100
Minimum value I assume that I want to make a hardware

23
00:00:55,366 --> 00:00:57,966
You can do both absolute value and minimum value at the same time.

24
00:00:57,966 --> 00:01:01,066
His cost will definitely not be the same as this one

25
00:01:01,066 --> 00:01:03,166
For example, suppose the cost is one

26
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:04,700
This cost is another

27
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,566
Originally, you wanted to make two, so two pairs were required, right?

28
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:09,366
Then we have to do it together

29
00:01:09,866 --> 00:01:11,566
Maybe 1.3

30
00:01:12,133 --> 00:01:15,466
The cost of 1.3 So this so-called

31
00:01:16,466 --> 00:01:19,800
The concept of functional unit sharing is also the same.

32
00:01:19,800 --> 00:01:22,400
Can you make this, this, and this together?

33
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,000
Originally it was 1,1,1

34
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,800
Then if you do it together now, it may be 1.6

35
00:01:26,966 --> 00:01:29,566
Then 1.6 is smaller than 3

36
00:01:29,566 --> 00:01:32,133
This is called functional unit sharing

37
00:01:32,133 --> 00:01:36,400
Can I save a little less in the temporary register just now?

38
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,200
Because my life span is different

39
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:40,533
So what are you doing today?

40
00:01:40,533 --> 00:01:41,400
You can see

41
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:43,433
This just came out

42
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:46,166
It's quite complicated for you guys.

43
00:01:46,333 --> 00:01:49,700
Can these functional units be shared?

44
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:51,100
but still the same

45
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:53,366
When can functional unit be shared?

46
00:01:53,366 --> 00:01:54,800
Same as scratchpad

47
00:01:55,333 --> 00:01:56,700
Unless you do this calculation

48
00:01:56,933 --> 00:01:59,233
I do this operation at different times

49
00:01:59,366 --> 00:02:00,666
I won't do it when you do it.

50
00:02:00,666 --> 00:02:01,766
You won't do it when I do it.

51
00:02:01,766 --> 00:02:02,700
Then I can do these two

52
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:05,933
Sharing can be designed to do two things at the same time

53
00:02:05,933 --> 00:02:08,400
Of course, it's the same if you want to share it with this one.

54
00:02:08,466 --> 00:02:09,933
I can't do it when you do it

55
00:02:09,933 --> 00:02:11,200
You can't do it while I'm doing it

56
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,866
This way my hardware can be shared, okay so

57
00:02:16,166 --> 00:02:19,200
functional unit sharing here

58
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:20,766
He will go down

59
00:02:20,933 --> 00:02:23,566
Can I do it?

60
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,900
Use a subtractor and then

61
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:27,466
Make the minimum

62
00:02:27,466 --> 00:02:29,066
I use a subtractor to do the maximum

63
00:02:29,066 --> 00:02:30,400
can i make one

64
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:33,733
Can be used as minimum or maximum

65
00:02:33,733 --> 00:02:35,666
Then I can even make one

66
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,266
The hardware performs absolute minimum, maximum and absolute values ​​at the same time.

67
00:02:39,400 --> 00:02:39,733
good

68
00:02:39,733 --> 00:02:43,366
Then I use a piece of hardware to do addition, absolute value, and subtraction at the same time.

69
00:02:43,366 --> 00:02:44,700
of course

70
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:48,300
But the premise

71
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:51,466
You want to put these operations on the same hardware

72
00:02:51,466 --> 00:02:54,666
cannot be done at the same time

73
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,600
So how to design this circuit?

74
00:02:56,600 --> 00:02:58,466
In fact, it’s the same as just now

75
00:02:58,533 --> 00:03:00,700
Register sharing is very similar to

76
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:02,066
So let's take a look

77
00:03:02,266 --> 00:03:05,333
Let's pull out this formula first.

78
00:03:05,333 --> 00:03:08,200
This is the state we distribute

79
00:03:08,600 --> 00:03:10,400
From S0 to S7

80
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:11,566
Okay, let me say it again

81
00:03:11,566 --> 00:03:14,133
You can also divide it into 9 states. You can also divide it into 20 states.

82
00:03:14,133 --> 00:03:15,666
Your status is different

83
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:17,666
Your entire design will be different.

84
00:03:17,666 --> 00:03:20,200
Okay, then we are now divided into 8 states.

85
00:03:20,200 --> 00:03:21,000
This is how you divide

86
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,766
So you can see what you did in s1

87
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,000
s1 made two absolute values

88
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,166
So your absolute value of two is marked like this

89
00:03:29,166 --> 00:03:32,200
What about s2? s2 is the maximum and minimum value

90
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:35,033
So one maximum value and one minimum value, right?

91
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,366
And what about S3

92
00:03:37,366 --> 00:03:40,300
In this state of S3, you have done two shifts

93
00:03:40,766 --> 00:03:42,700
S4 you made a subtraction

94
00:03:43,100 --> 00:03:45,133
S5 you made a plus

95
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:47,533
If so, just mark it

96
00:03:47,533 --> 00:03:49,266
So what did you do with S6?

97
00:03:49,266 --> 00:03:51,166
You should mark it well

98
00:03:51,333 --> 00:03:54,800
Okay, it’s the same thing. It’s the same thing if you want to share it.

99
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,866
What are the only situations where you can share?

100
00:03:58,866 --> 00:04:02,533
Those actions cannot be performed in the same state

101
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,500
So what should we do?

102
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:06,866
In fact, he has a look like this

103
00:04:07,066 --> 00:04:08,066
like information engineering department

104
00:04:08,066 --> 00:04:10,333
The kind of graph theory method that I am more familiar with

105
00:04:10,333 --> 00:04:12,800
In fact, what is the graph theory method?

106
00:04:12,800 --> 00:04:13,333
I am like this

107
00:04:13,333 --> 00:04:15,700
Do I have two absolutes to do now?

108
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,566
Then I drew a dotted line

109
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:19,466
Why draw a dotted line?

110
00:04:19,566 --> 00:04:23,066
The representative said they were in the same state

111
00:04:23,133 --> 00:04:25,666
Then I have minimum and maximum to do.

112
00:04:25,666 --> 00:04:27,433
Because he is in the same state

113
00:04:27,500 --> 00:04:28,300
so

114
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,600
I also drew a dotted line for minimum and maximum

115
00:04:32,933 --> 00:04:34,133
Okay then what

116
00:04:34,133 --> 00:04:35,766
I have another shift

117
00:04:35,766 --> 00:04:37,733
Since there is no cost, it doesn't matter much.

118
00:04:37,733 --> 00:04:39,933
I have a subtraction and an addition

119
00:04:39,933 --> 00:04:41,966
That subtraction and addition are in different states

120
00:04:41,966 --> 00:04:43,333
So he has no dotted line

121
00:04:43,333 --> 00:04:44,500
I have additions and subtractions

122
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:46,800
Okay, let me ask everyone

123
00:04:46,900 --> 00:04:49,400
Look at the operations required for each state.

124
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:50,733
Each state requires operations

125
00:04:50,733 --> 00:04:52,133
Operations required for each state

126
00:04:52,133 --> 00:04:54,066
If you use this table to figure it out

127
00:04:54,066 --> 00:04:55,766
I ask everyone that every status

128
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:58,900
At least a few operations are required

129
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,133
There are only two operations at most.

130
00:05:01,133 --> 00:05:03,633
Each state has at most two operations

131
00:05:03,966 --> 00:05:06,366
Right? So you can imagine

132
00:05:06,366 --> 00:05:08,300
In fact, I only need two computing units

133
00:05:08,300 --> 00:05:10,266
Just two operations can complete

134
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:13,000
Because in every state of my life

135
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,300
There will only be at most two operations to be done

136
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:18,200
This is how he sees it

137
00:05:18,200 --> 00:05:20,533
Because you have so many calculations to do

138
00:05:20,533 --> 00:05:22,066
But in different states there will be

139
00:05:22,066 --> 00:05:23,133
different operations to be done

140
00:05:23,133 --> 00:05:23,933
but

141
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:27,733
If you look at it this way

142
00:05:27,733 --> 00:05:29,200
every state of your

143
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:31,566
There are only two operations to be done at the same time

144
00:05:31,566 --> 00:05:34,200
So I can actually do it with just two pieces of hardware.

145
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,066
You watch it again and come back here

146
00:05:36,200 --> 00:05:37,566
what does this mean

147
00:05:39,666 --> 00:05:40,533
From your side

148
00:05:40,533 --> 00:05:44,700
Here 12345678 did you use 8 hardware?

149
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,266
Then we will tell you now

150
00:05:46,466 --> 00:05:49,600
Each state only has at most two pieces of hardware to do.

151
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:51,866
So actually I only have two hardware bodies here

152
00:05:51,866 --> 00:05:53,233
I can handle it.

153
00:05:53,666 --> 00:05:56,100
I only have two pieces of hardware and I can do it.

154
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,000
I only have two pieces of hardware and I can do it.

155
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,366
So I can do it with two pieces of hardware.

156
00:06:02,366 --> 00:06:03,800
This is the conclusion reached here

157
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:05,266
I need at least two

158
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:08,000
Two operations and two hardware

159
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,966
Then I came to the dotted line today

160
00:06:09,966 --> 00:06:12,333
Okay, so what's next?

161
00:06:12,333 --> 00:06:15,366
What he actually uses is good stuff like graph theory.

162
00:06:15,366 --> 00:06:17,033
Do I only need two pieces of hardware?

163
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,900
Okay, then I'll circle it. I'll circle it like this.

164
00:06:19,966 --> 00:06:21,700
Can I be like this?

165
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,133
These two are circled together

166
00:06:23,133 --> 00:06:26,266
These four are circled together. This is a kind of circle.

167
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:27,566
Look

168
00:06:27,566 --> 00:06:30,133
Then it’s okay to circle like this

169
00:06:30,133 --> 00:06:32,133
Well, then, then, you pay attention, pay attention, pay attention

170
00:06:32,133 --> 00:06:33,900
No matter you circle it like this or this way

171
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:36,066
Let me ask you, how many red circles have you circled?

172
00:06:36,166 --> 00:06:37,366
Two groups?

173
00:06:37,366 --> 00:06:39,466
Because you only need two hardware bodies

174
00:06:39,466 --> 00:06:41,633
Right? Then why are you

175
00:06:41,766 --> 00:06:45,766
Those with dotted lines cannot be enclosed in the same hardware body.

176
00:06:45,966 --> 00:06:48,400
There is a dotted line because it means he has to do it at the same time

177
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:50,800
Then he needs to be assigned different hardware

178
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,600
The dotted line means he has to do it at the same time

179
00:06:52,600 --> 00:06:54,266
He needs to be assigned different hardware

180
00:06:54,266 --> 00:06:55,766
So I can circle

181
00:06:55,766 --> 00:06:58,033
This is a circle method. These two groups are

182
00:06:58,166 --> 00:06:59,500
These four groups

183
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:02,366
You can also do this in groups of 3

184
00:07:02,366 --> 00:07:05,366
Of course, these three can be exchanged.

185
00:07:05,366 --> 00:07:06,000
no problem

186
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:08,466
Then the result will be different

187
00:07:08,466 --> 00:07:10,033
So you can see

188
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:11,400
you can

189
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:12,700
You do the math like this

190
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:13,600
you will know

191
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:15,266
In fact, you only need two sets of hardware

192
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:16,000
So in other words

193
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,600
What this means is that I have a hardware that can also

194
00:07:18,666 --> 00:07:20,600
My hardware can do absolute values

195
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:22,233
You can also do the minimum value

196
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:23,933
I have another hardware

197
00:07:23,933 --> 00:07:25,400
Can do absolute value

198
00:07:25,400 --> 00:07:26,700
Can be the minimum value

199
00:07:26,700 --> 00:07:29,466
Can do subtraction. Can do addition. Good.

200
00:07:29,466 --> 00:07:30,866
Then if you use it like this, say I have it

201
00:07:30,866 --> 00:07:34,000
A piece of hardware that can do absolute minima and addition

202
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,166
My other hardware

203
00:07:35,166 --> 00:07:37,800
You can do absolute maximum value and subtraction

204
00:07:38,366 --> 00:07:42,900
Okay, then, do we want this or this?

205
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,700
Then we can do the math

206
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:46,700
What if

207
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:49,766
I have a hardware with absolute value and minimum

208
00:07:49,766 --> 00:07:51,800
Then I probably need a few logic gates

209
00:07:52,366 --> 00:07:55,133
Several adders, several logic gates

210
00:07:55,133 --> 00:07:57,100
Then if these four are in a group

211
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:58,666
Then I probably need this

212
00:07:58,966 --> 00:08:03,000
Okay, then my total sum is two, one, one, two, two

213
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:06,000
Okay, what if I divide it like this?

214
00:08:06,766 --> 00:08:09,066
Am I in a group?

215
00:08:09,066 --> 00:08:12,133
Absolute value, minimum value, plus a group of these three

216
00:08:12,133 --> 00:08:13,900
Then I want 1,1,1,2

217
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:16,366
Then these three groups

218
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:19,200
Absolute value, maximum value, minus one, one, one, two

219
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:21,766
That adds up to two, one, one, two, two

220
00:08:21,766 --> 00:08:22,766
you will find

221
00:08:22,766 --> 00:08:25,100
In fact, you use the above division method

222
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,966
Or the following division

223
00:08:26,966 --> 00:08:29,233
Your total cost is the same

224
00:08:29,666 --> 00:08:32,700
So the representative said that actually both divisions are acceptable.

225
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:34,966
But you must divide into two groups

226
00:08:35,566 --> 00:08:38,066
Okay, so what about your circuit after you divide it?

227
00:08:38,066 --> 00:08:40,966
The circuit will be much cleaner like this

228
00:08:41,333 --> 00:08:44,500
Have you ever looked at what it was like?

229
00:08:45,133 --> 00:08:46,966
It turned out to be like

230
00:08:49,733 --> 00:08:53,200
It turns out it’s like this, right?

231
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:55,133
Look at the three temporary registers

232
00:08:55,133 --> 00:08:57,833
But there are so many functional units at the back

233
00:08:57,933 --> 00:09:00,166
Now after you divide it into two groups

234
00:09:00,166 --> 00:09:02,000
After being divided into two groups, it looks like this

235
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:05,966
You still have three temporary registers, right?

236
00:09:05,966 --> 00:09:09,100
You have two sets of hardware and this is one way

237
00:09:09,566 --> 00:09:10,900
absolute value,minimum

238
00:09:10,933 --> 00:09:12,866
Absolute value, maximum, addition, subtraction

239
00:09:12,866 --> 00:09:16,500
It’s the above division method

240
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,366
Then if you look at your line, it will become

241
00:09:18,366 --> 00:09:19,700
A bit simpler

242
00:09:19,766 --> 00:09:21,966
Then why can these two be grouped together?

243
00:09:21,966 --> 00:09:23,566
It’s because it’s absolutely worth doing it

244
00:09:23,566 --> 00:09:24,900
I will never do the minimum

245
00:09:24,966 --> 00:09:27,600
When doing minimum, you will not do absolute value.

246
00:09:27,733 --> 00:09:29,566
So you can group it together

247
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,400
Then these four can be grouped together

248
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:33,766
It’s because you can’t do it when doing absolute values.

249
00:09:33,766 --> 00:09:35,566
maximum, and I can’t do any additions.

250
00:09:35,566 --> 00:09:36,866
I won’t do any reduction either.

251
00:09:36,866 --> 00:09:38,400
because you see

252
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:39,966
When you do absolute value

253
00:09:39,966 --> 00:09:42,233
In fact, nothing else was done.

254
00:09:42,666 --> 00:09:44,766
So this is how you divide it

255
00:09:44,766 --> 00:09:47,466
These operations can be grouped into the same group

256
00:09:47,533 --> 00:09:50,600
It's because their time is different

257
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,700
If the time is the same, you have already used a dotted line.

258
00:09:52,700 --> 00:09:54,433
So you just put it

259
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:57,466
When they gather together, they are divided into different categories

260
00:09:57,466 --> 00:09:59,900
Then there's no problem

261
00:09:59,900 --> 00:10:01,333
So this is a way?

262
00:10:01,333 --> 00:10:03,100
One of unit sharing

263
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:06,266
This is probably what you would do manually today.

264
00:10:06,266 --> 00:10:08,366
Then if you look at your line, it will become

265
00:10:08,666 --> 00:10:10,000
A bit simpler

266
00:10:10,166 --> 00:10:10,966
good

267
00:10:10,966 --> 00:10:13,366
If you are in another way today

268
00:10:13,366 --> 00:10:14,766
That is to say, these three

269
00:10:14,766 --> 00:10:16,266
Then his circuit will be different

270
00:10:16,266 --> 00:10:18,166
You see this is

271
00:10:18,166 --> 00:10:19,733
Two or four

272
00:10:19,733 --> 00:10:21,966
Then this one is three by three

273
00:10:21,966 --> 00:10:23,966
Then his lines will look different.

274
00:10:24,166 --> 00:10:26,100
But the cost is the same

275
00:10:26,100 --> 00:10:27,966
Because we just calculated it here

276
00:10:27,966 --> 00:10:30,200
Basically his cost is the same

277
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:32,900
So it should be said that both methods are possible

278
00:10:32,900 --> 00:10:34,166
It will be all right

279
00:10:34,166 --> 00:10:35,366
Because the cost is the same

280
00:10:35,366 --> 00:10:37,700
You just need to divide into two groups.

281
00:10:37,700 --> 00:10:40,300
Then why is this shifter not regulated here?

282
00:10:40,300 --> 00:10:42,700
Because the shifter is basically free of cost

283
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:45,266
So we don’t consider the shifter here.

284
00:10:45,266 --> 00:10:47,600
Just consider these more complicated ones

285
00:10:47,766 --> 00:10:49,066
Okay, of course

286
00:10:49,100 --> 00:10:50,233
say it again

287
00:10:51,666 --> 00:10:52,933
You have to think like this

288
00:10:52,933 --> 00:10:54,966
The absolute referring cost is assumed to be one

289
00:10:54,966 --> 00:10:56,233
minimum is one

290
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:57,733
Then you were originally 1+1

291
00:10:57,733 --> 00:11:01,266
It originally cost 2, but now you put it together and it might cost 1.5

292
00:11:01,266 --> 00:11:03,866
But 1.5 is still smaller than 2

293
00:11:03,866 --> 00:11:07,333
Then you originally wanted one, two, three, four or four.

294
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,166
You're probably sitting together at 1.8 right now

295
00:11:10,166 --> 00:11:13,100
But 1.8 is still much smaller than 4, which is good

296
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:14,566
You have to think about it this way

297
00:11:14,566 --> 00:11:15,866
That makes sense

298
00:11:15,866 --> 00:11:18,900
This is called functional unit sharing

299
00:11:18,900 --> 00:11:21,333
As long as we do this operation

300
00:11:21,333 --> 00:11:23,100
are to be done at different times

301
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:26,033
I can share this functional unit

302
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:27,633
Okay then

303
00:11:28,133 --> 00:11:30,066
Here we have to mention a little bit

304
00:11:30,066 --> 00:11:31,933
We talked about two sharing

305
00:11:31,933 --> 00:11:34,566
We talked about two shared

306
00:11:34,566 --> 00:11:36,300
We talked about two shared

307
00:11:36,300 --> 00:11:37,666
that is

308
00:11:37,666 --> 00:11:40,400
storage sharing and functional unit sharing

309
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,900
A classmate just came and asked a very good question.

310
00:11:42,900 --> 00:11:45,900
He said: Teacher, when we are taking the exam

311
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:47,200
our homework

312
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,100
We need to optimize the area

313
00:11:50,100 --> 00:11:51,633
I want to reduce costs

314
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,266
Do I want to use this?

315
00:11:54,766 --> 00:11:56,566
Basically you won't use it

316
00:11:57,500 --> 00:11:58,700
Why

317
00:11:58,866 --> 00:12:00,400
We just listened

318
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:02,366
You won't get down to this level anymore

319
00:12:02,366 --> 00:12:05,400
In fact, our homework or exam

320
00:12:05,400 --> 00:12:07,700
You just need to put your Verilog

321
00:12:07,733 --> 00:12:10,066
Just write behavior tVerilog

322
00:12:10,066 --> 00:12:11,700
We didn't get this

323
00:12:11,933 --> 00:12:13,366
because you want

324
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,066
How scary it is to take exams like this

325
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:18,700
You see, your circuit is very small.

326
00:12:18,700 --> 00:12:20,066
Your circuit is very small

327
00:12:20,066 --> 00:12:22,166
So you can calculate 3 temporary registers

328
00:12:22,166 --> 00:12:24,600
Then you can also manually enter this line

329
00:12:24,900 --> 00:12:28,433
You have to think that if your temporary register is 20

330
00:12:29,166 --> 00:12:32,100
20 pieces should not be picked up manually.

331
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:34,266
Because you have to finish drawing this page before you can write about him.

332
00:12:34,266 --> 00:12:35,366
Verilog

333
00:12:35,466 --> 00:12:38,766
Because every connection you make has meaning

334
00:12:38,933 --> 00:12:39,266
so

335
00:12:39,266 --> 00:12:42,066
After you drew this picture manually,

336
00:12:42,066 --> 00:12:43,333
Shine again

337
00:12:43,333 --> 00:12:44,866
Print this Verilog

338
00:12:44,866 --> 00:12:47,466
That’s why I said you are writing at gate level.

339
00:12:48,066 --> 00:12:51,300
So you need to optimize this storage

340
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:53,300
Basically the questions on our exam

341
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:54,866
No such requirement

342
00:12:54,866 --> 00:12:56,866
Homework is not too scary because of this.

343
00:12:56,866 --> 00:12:58,600
Because our topic is relatively big

344
00:12:58,600 --> 00:13:00,200
We are just giving this example

345
00:13:00,366 --> 00:13:02,766
As a small question, you can do this

346
00:13:03,066 --> 00:13:06,266
If you really have to do it manually for a big problem

347
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,366
That's unlikely

348
00:13:11,366 --> 00:13:14,700
Almost almost impossible

349
00:13:14,700 --> 00:13:16,900
But I say it makes sense academically

350
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,300
Because when you were doing your thesis

351
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:21,800
Because your thesis might be about writing an adder

352
00:13:21,900 --> 00:13:24,566
You may be making a simple circuit

353
00:13:24,966 --> 00:13:27,733
Then there are 3 less temporary registers at this time

354
00:13:27,733 --> 00:13:29,066
5 less registers

355
00:13:29,066 --> 00:13:31,600
Or functional unit sharing

356
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:33,366
This all contributes

357
00:13:33,366 --> 00:13:35,400
These are all academic contributions

358
00:13:35,700 --> 00:13:36,700
But you're writing Verilog

359
00:13:36,700 --> 00:13:38,900
Go down to this level and write

360
00:13:38,900 --> 00:13:41,733
Let me tell you, you can’t finish this homework

361
00:13:41,733 --> 00:13:44,566
You can’t finish your homework and you can’t finish your exams either.

362
00:13:44,566 --> 00:13:47,366
So we didn't ask for this

363
00:13:47,366 --> 00:13:49,866
You just need to put verilog us

364
00:13:49,966 --> 00:13:53,400
I remind you in class that you should write well, just write it well

365
00:13:53,500 --> 00:13:55,366
What if

366
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,533
That's a matter of the level of your algorithm.

367
00:13:59,766 --> 00:14:01,866
I definitely didn’t ask you to go down to this level.

368
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:02,900
Absolutely not

369
00:14:03,700 --> 00:14:06,566
那functional unit sharing

370
00:14:06,766 --> 00:14:08,966
I can't guarantee it

371
00:14:08,966 --> 00:14:09,900
There must be no storage sharing

372
00:14:10,133 --> 00:14:12,433
functional unit sharing

373
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:17,300
If your topic is big

374
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:19,133
Because you want me to be functional

375
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:21,066
Our current function is very small

376
00:14:21,066 --> 00:14:22,766
What is our function?

377
00:14:23,133 --> 00:14:24,166
Adjustment

378
00:14:25,166 --> 00:14:27,300
It's just an absolute value operation, right?

379
00:14:27,300 --> 00:14:29,466
Okay, then you need to enlarge it.

380
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:31,600
This is the only function you have

381
00:14:32,466 --> 00:14:34,400
When will you do functional unit sharing?

382
00:14:34,400 --> 00:14:35,300
You have to imagine

383
00:14:35,300 --> 00:14:36,700
If I say today

384
00:14:36,933 --> 00:14:40,700
For example, let's say I am a compressed circuit

385
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:45,300
This function is compressed into this area

386
00:14:46,333 --> 00:14:50,166
Then your other actions today are very big

387
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:52,400
Then press this area into a small area

388
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:54,800
If this can be shared

389
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:57,500
Then this may cost a lot.

390
00:14:57,500 --> 00:14:58,400
If you don’t share

391
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:01,066
For example, when student A is in the crimping area

392
00:15:01,066 --> 00:15:02,133
Classmate B is pressing

393
00:15:02,133 --> 00:15:03,766
Student B is pressing at the same time

394
00:15:04,066 --> 00:15:06,200
You will need 3 copies of this

395
00:15:07,366 --> 00:15:10,100
So I can’t even guarantee you functional unit sharing.

396
00:15:10,100 --> 00:15:13,166
But every time you make a share

397
00:15:13,166 --> 00:15:14,800
You know that. You don’t want to share it so much.

398
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,766
That should be said

399
00:15:16,766 --> 00:15:19,566
If there were only these additions, subtractions, multiplications and divisions

400
00:15:19,566 --> 00:15:21,333
You don't have to share a functional unit.

401
00:15:21,333 --> 00:15:23,666
You don't have to, you don't have to, absolutely you don't have to

402
00:15:24,266 --> 00:15:25,800
Absolutely not

403
00:15:25,800 --> 00:15:26,400
Absolutely not

404
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,166
If a small circuit like ours

405
00:15:28,166 --> 00:15:30,133
You don't need

406
00:15:30,133 --> 00:15:32,500
Then what I'm talking about is that if you want it, you need to enlarge it.

407
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:33,300
Your functional unit sharing

408
00:15:33,300 --> 00:15:37,100
If you are making a very complicated circuit

409
00:15:37,466 --> 00:15:40,466
Think of it as a big circuit

410
00:15:40,666 --> 00:15:43,100
You will need three for this circuit

411
00:15:43,300 --> 00:15:44,600
Three such large circuits

412
00:15:44,600 --> 00:15:46,133
Then your costs may become very high

413
00:15:46,133 --> 00:15:48,133
But if your time is up

414
00:15:48,133 --> 00:15:50,266
B will not do it when a does it

415
00:15:50,266 --> 00:15:50,900
Then you yourself

416
00:15:50,900 --> 00:15:54,600
In fact, we need to use the same hardware to plan

417
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,800
But if addition, subtraction, multiplication and division are like this

418
00:15:58,266 --> 00:15:59,366
It doesn't matter

419
00:15:59,366 --> 00:16:01,566
The impact is not that big

420
00:16:01,766 --> 00:16:03,700
Okay, this won't let you

421
00:16:03,700 --> 00:16:05,766
If you really want to go down to that

422
00:16:06,500 --> 00:16:07,866
It's troublesome

423
00:16:07,866 --> 00:16:10,366
So, and you can see

424
00:16:10,366 --> 00:16:11,800
Actually you did this

425
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,466
It is possible that it will go down to the gate level.

426
00:16:14,466 --> 00:16:17,366
But if your module is fixed

427
00:16:17,366 --> 00:16:20,200
Your module is very large. In fact, there may be one more state.

428
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:23,666
Just redraw your state diagram.

429
00:16:23,666 --> 00:16:25,800
So it should be said like this

430
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:28,100
So although we gave this example

431
00:16:28,100 --> 00:16:29,200
Don't think about it

432
00:16:29,200 --> 00:16:31,566
When we take the exam

433
00:16:31,666 --> 00:16:33,700
What register sharing

434
00:16:33,700 --> 00:16:36,133
Come and put it to good use

435
00:16:36,133 --> 00:16:37,700
Then you won’t be able to finish writing like this

436
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:39,600
I can only tell you this

437
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:41,433
Then this is meaningless

438
00:16:41,533 --> 00:16:43,033
well

439
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,366
Then wait a minute

440
00:16:45,366 --> 00:16:46,833
The third lesson

441
00:16:47,133 --> 00:16:49,566
The teaching assistant will send that

442
00:16:49,866 --> 00:16:52,000
The fourth assignment

443
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:53,666
We're going to give out the fourth assignment

444
00:16:53,666 --> 00:16:57,633
At the same time, he will review

445
00:16:58,066 --> 00:17:01,300
The one who took the midterm exam will give you an example

446
00:17:01,300 --> 00:17:03,500
That is, he will take the midterm exam

447
00:17:03,733 --> 00:17:06,666
How to write it? I sorted it out in detail.

448
00:17:06,766 --> 00:17:08,700
Then I'm still the same here

449
00:17:08,700 --> 00:17:10,366
I want to tell you something

450
00:17:11,366 --> 00:17:13,966
You must do well if you don't do well in the midterm exam

451
00:17:13,966 --> 00:17:15,733
If you do well in the exam, there's no problem

452
00:17:15,733 --> 00:17:18,566
Because I have confessed

453
00:17:18,766 --> 00:17:21,200
I've already discussed that with the teaching assistant.

454
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,366
In addition to following our final exam

455
00:17:24,066 --> 00:17:26,400
The midterm exam is somewhat similar

456
00:17:26,733 --> 00:17:31,000
So you must fully understand the midterm exam

457
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,333
If you go back and rewrite yourself

458
00:17:33,333 --> 00:17:34,800
Can write very well

459
00:17:34,800 --> 00:17:36,600
Of course the teaching assistant will talk today

460
00:17:36,600 --> 00:17:38,233
I will take the midterm exam

461
00:17:38,333 --> 00:17:40,333
Then I think the best way is

462
00:17:40,333 --> 00:17:41,533
He has a code for you to see

463
00:17:41,533 --> 00:17:43,966
You can give it a rough look and then go back and rewrite it yourself.

464
00:17:43,966 --> 00:17:46,000
Then do it again then

465
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,100
You will know that your code is different from others

466
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:49,533
Where

467
00:17:49,533 --> 00:17:52,133
Then you must do well in your midterm exam.

468
00:17:52,133 --> 00:17:53,766
Then you do this for your final exam

469
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:55,900
If you don't do well on the midterm exam

470
00:17:55,900 --> 00:17:58,200
It will be easier for you to make up for your final exam.

471
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,400
because we will

472
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,466
Try to be an extension of the midterm exam

473
00:18:03,466 --> 00:18:06,700
I have discussed it with the teaching assistant

474
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,300
The simplest way

475
00:18:09,300 --> 00:18:11,133
I hope everyone can pass

476
00:18:11,133 --> 00:18:12,466
Because really

477
00:18:12,466 --> 00:18:14,766
I don’t want to be you either

478
00:18:14,966 --> 00:18:15,766
That

479
00:18:17,933 --> 00:18:19,766
Then this and this

480
00:18:19,766 --> 00:18:21,200
Let's stop here for a moment

481
00:18:21,200 --> 00:18:23,033
Let's take a look at this

482
00:18:23,466 --> 00:18:25,200
To encourage everyone

483
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:27,466
Everyone worked very hard to write the program.

484
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,800
We want to encourage everyone

485
00:18:31,066 --> 00:18:33,000
Look at last year

486
00:18:33,566 --> 00:18:37,033
I think everyone should have seen that

487
00:18:37,933 --> 00:18:39,066
some news

488
00:18:39,066 --> 00:18:41,700
How much did MediaTek spend last year?

489
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:44,133
Then how much did Novatek spend last year?

490
00:18:44,133 --> 00:18:45,500
So why is this happening?

491
00:18:45,500 --> 00:18:47,066
In fact, you can tell at a glance

492
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,600
MediaTek’s revenue the year before last was 320 billion

493
00:18:52,566 --> 00:18:55,900
Last year it surged to 490 billion

494
00:18:56,133 --> 00:18:58,600
So last year’s turnover was that of the year before

495
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:00,500
170 billion more

496
00:19:00,733 --> 00:19:03,866
There is also the one from the past

497
00:19:04,466 --> 00:19:07,100
There is also that next one

498
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:09,266
I will give a lecture at the Department of Engineering next week

499
00:19:09,266 --> 00:19:10,266
It should be next week

500
00:19:10,266 --> 00:19:12,866
I invited them to give a speech at the Department of Engineering

501
00:19:12,900 --> 00:19:15,900
Novatek's turnover is only 80 billion

502
00:19:16,666 --> 00:19:19,566
Last year, 135 billion

503
00:19:20,166 --> 00:19:25,033
Just imagine him, he changes from 80 billion to 135 billion

504
00:19:25,466 --> 00:19:28,766
Moreover, look at this IC factory

505
00:19:28,766 --> 00:19:31,133
The profit is 30%

506
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:33,800
It’s just that he is not 3% or 5%

507
00:19:34,133 --> 00:19:36,000
his his that

508
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:40,333
The profit is 30%

509
00:19:40,333 --> 00:19:44,366
And if you look at United Wing, he said 1,350

510
00:19:44,366 --> 00:19:48,233
130 billion 130 billion Novatek has less than 3,000 people

511
00:19:48,666 --> 00:19:51,100
Then look at the output value of each person

512
00:19:51,266 --> 00:19:52,733
Less than 3,000 employees

513
00:19:52,733 --> 00:19:55,333
Almost all of them are engineers

514
00:19:55,333 --> 00:19:58,100
Less than 3,000 employees, he can’t reach 1,300

515
00:19:58,766 --> 00:20:01,833
What about Realtek? It was originally the same one.

516
00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:08,800
He should have been close to 77 billion originally.

517
00:20:08,966 --> 00:20:11,766
It also reached 100 billion last year

518
00:20:11,766 --> 00:20:13,666
That Qijing Optoelectronics turned out to be

519
00:20:13,766 --> 00:20:16,200
More than 20 billion. Last year, it reached more than 40 billion.

520
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:19,233
Qijing Optoelectronics is the one that built the third motor hall now.

521
00:20:19,266 --> 00:20:21,733
You can see that this is

522
00:20:21,733 --> 00:20:24,166
That's also because you can see

523
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,833
The year before last

524
00:20:25,900 --> 00:20:27,433
So Taiwan

525
00:20:27,900 --> 00:20:31,766
IC design enters top ten in the world in 2020

526
00:20:31,766 --> 00:20:35,000
In fact, only the first three are in the top ten.

527
00:20:35,133 --> 00:20:37,100
Last year even the wonders came in

528
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:41,766
So last year, there were actually 4 companies in the top ten.

529
00:20:41,766 --> 00:20:44,900
Of course, this is actually more than just that.

530
00:20:44,900 --> 00:20:46,833
For example, Phison

531
00:20:47,066 --> 00:20:49,800
Look at Phison, it only made over 10 billion last year

532
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,966
No, because if he connects the module

533
00:20:51,966 --> 00:20:54,500
His turnover last year was about 60 billion

534
00:20:54,500 --> 00:20:56,566
Because he doesn't just sell chips

535
00:20:56,566 --> 00:20:58,800
Weilong is written here

536
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:01,266
He's not just selling chips when it comes to group acting.

537
00:21:01,266 --> 00:21:03,733
He also sells modules

538
00:21:03,733 --> 00:21:04,200
so

539
00:21:04,200 --> 00:21:06,800
But you see, his module didn’t include it.

540
00:21:06,800 --> 00:21:09,933
Otherwise, Phison actually didn’t even make modules last year.

541
00:21:09,933 --> 00:21:11,933
It’s not just about making more than 10 billion

542
00:21:11,933 --> 00:21:14,233
It’s 60 billion

543
00:21:14,366 --> 00:21:17,666
So this is actually the whole

544
00:21:18,200 --> 00:21:22,433
Why is the salary high and then that?

545
00:21:22,866 --> 00:21:25,600
It's probably because of this or this.

546
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:27,100
So you can see

547
00:21:27,133 --> 00:21:30,800
Last year it was all over, so this year maybe

548
00:21:31,533 --> 00:21:33,300
I think it might not be as bad as last year

549
00:21:33,300 --> 00:21:36,200
Not that good. Sorry.

550
00:21:36,266 --> 00:21:37,333
It's not as good as last year

551
00:21:37,333 --> 00:21:39,666
But you just have to be in the middle

552
00:21:39,666 --> 00:21:44,033
That should be the entire turnover

553
00:21:44,866 --> 00:21:45,666
That

554
00:21:46,300 --> 00:21:48,633
What are you going to do if you

555
00:21:49,666 --> 00:21:52,566
I didn't do well on the midterm exam.

556
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:54,133
Then you still have to work hard

557
00:21:54,133 --> 00:21:55,300
I can only say this

558
00:21:55,300 --> 00:21:58,333
Because actually I don’t know how to help you

559
00:21:58,333 --> 00:22:00,666
But you are good

560
00:22:01,066 --> 00:22:05,300
Write well. You write well and then

561
00:22:05,733 --> 00:22:10,000
You can ask the teaching assistant and then you can put

562
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,766
Today because

563
00:22:10,766 --> 00:22:12,366
Because I specially confessed today

564
00:22:12,366 --> 00:22:14,766
The teaching assistant must explain that

565
00:22:15,100 --> 00:22:17,433
That midterm exam

566
00:22:17,466 --> 00:22:20,166
If you don't do well in the midterm exam,

567
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,466
a chance for my classmates

568
00:22:21,466 --> 00:22:23,266
You should at least trace code

569
00:22:24,133 --> 00:22:26,266
Then what should I tell you?

570
00:22:26,266 --> 00:22:27,633
this matter

571
00:22:28,566 --> 00:22:30,533
It just depends on whether you want to spend time

572
00:22:30,533 --> 00:22:33,700
You can do it as long as you take the time

573
00:22:33,700 --> 00:22:36,066
You can definitely do it if you take the time

574
00:22:36,700 --> 00:22:39,366
Then I last time

575
00:22:39,933 --> 00:22:41,766
I should have given you an example.

576
00:22:41,800 --> 00:22:43,266
I

577
00:22:43,266 --> 00:22:44,666
Before I went to Chengdu University to teach

578
00:22:44,666 --> 00:22:46,666
I still teach at Nantai University

579
00:22:46,866 --> 00:22:50,133
My first graduate student

580
00:22:50,133 --> 00:22:52,166
That is, the graduate student who founded the mountain

581
00:22:52,166 --> 00:22:53,500
It was collected at Nan Tai University.

582
00:22:53,500 --> 00:22:56,766
I am the first graduate student in Southern Taiwan

583
00:22:57,066 --> 00:22:59,366
He turned out to be an elevator worker

584
00:22:59,933 --> 00:23:01,266
That

585
00:23:01,800 --> 00:23:04,166
How do you calculate that your level should be better than his?

586
00:23:04,166 --> 00:23:06,300
The so-called elevator worker means

587
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:09,766
He actually turned out to be a student from a fifth college

588
00:23:10,166 --> 00:23:10,666
That

589
00:23:10,666 --> 00:23:14,000
Did you know that the fifth college is where you go after graduating from junior high school?

590
00:23:14,066 --> 00:23:16,866
That’s because he has been practicing in five specialties for five years

591
00:23:17,400 --> 00:23:21,700
Those fifth majors were because he was "too good"

592
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,766
So I didn’t graduate from the fifth secondary school in five years.

593
00:23:25,766 --> 00:23:28,133
Didn't he go to the army after graduation?

594
00:23:28,133 --> 00:23:29,933
After serving in the army, he went to work as an elevator worker

595
00:23:29,933 --> 00:23:30,966
Then the elevator worker

596
00:23:30,966 --> 00:23:33,166
In fact, he only earns more than 10,000 yuan a month

597
00:23:34,266 --> 00:23:36,300
that 24 hours then

598
00:23:36,300 --> 00:23:38,500
And because the elevator only needs to be replaced once

599
00:23:38,500 --> 00:23:39,766
He wants it. He wants it.

600
00:23:39,766 --> 00:23:41,800
Were you called to repair the elevator?

601
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,966
Later, he wanted to think that it would be impossible to live like this for the rest of his life.

602
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:45,833
He

603
00:23:46,700 --> 00:23:48,833
Come to Nantai University to study evening department

604
00:23:48,933 --> 00:23:50,400
Is the night department because of the fifth major?

605
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:51,400
After graduating from fifth college

606
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,933
Then I will study in my junior and senior years.

607
00:23:52,933 --> 00:23:54,533
Just get that

608
00:23:54,533 --> 00:23:56,866
Bachelor's certificate

609
00:23:56,866 --> 00:24:00,266
Because their fifth junior college is actually counted as three years of high school.

610
00:24:00,266 --> 00:24:01,566
Then I will be a freshman or sophomore

611
00:24:02,166 --> 00:24:03,766
You may not know this well

612
00:24:03,766 --> 00:24:06,300
Then he only needs to practice for two more years

613
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:08,100
It’s like a junior or senior year

614
00:24:08,100 --> 00:24:10,066
He can get a college diploma

615
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,466
But his

616
00:24:13,133 --> 00:24:15,366
At that time in Nantai

617
00:24:15,866 --> 00:24:18,200
The night department has not graduated yet

618
00:24:18,300 --> 00:24:19,600
I passed the exam

619
00:24:20,733 --> 00:24:23,000
The graduate school of the department where I teach

620
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:24,433
Because it was the first

621
00:24:24,666 --> 00:24:26,766
The first batch of graduate students

622
00:24:26,766 --> 00:24:27,500
It's a good test.

623
00:24:27,500 --> 00:24:30,700
That is, you only need to teach for 1,500 or 2,500 that you signed up for.

624
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:31,866
I'll definitely get there

625
00:24:31,900 --> 00:24:34,466
Because no one wants to take the exam

626
00:24:34,466 --> 00:24:36,166
That

627
00:24:36,933 --> 00:24:38,600
Because it's hard for him to imagine

628
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:42,366
Some I I I give you an example you know

629
00:24:42,366 --> 00:24:44,866
Are private school graduate schools good or not?

630
00:24:44,866 --> 00:24:46,866
Imagine that situation

631
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:49,400
Questions from our institute

632
00:24:49,400 --> 00:24:52,500
There are no multiple-choice questions or fill-in questions.

633
00:24:52,866 --> 00:24:56,366
Why do you ask fill-in questions and multiple-choice questions?

634
00:24:56,900 --> 00:24:59,700
Because there is a standard answer, he will get 0 points

635
00:24:59,733 --> 00:25:02,000
A student with a score of 0 cannot be admitted.

636
00:25:02,866 --> 00:25:04,933
So because there are too few people taking the exam

637
00:25:04,933 --> 00:25:06,733
I admitted 30 people today

638
00:25:06,733 --> 00:25:08,766
Maybe only 20 people come to take the exam

639
00:25:08,966 --> 00:25:12,066
In order to make money, the school must admit everyone

640
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:13,200
What should I do?

641
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:14,866
All require quizzes

642
00:25:15,066 --> 00:25:17,966
Q&A: All he needs to do is sign and write "Teacher, you are so great"

643
00:25:17,966 --> 00:25:19,400
I can give him 3 points

644
00:25:19,400 --> 00:25:21,766
He won't be 0 points

645
00:25:21,766 --> 00:25:23,333
A score of 0 cannot be admitted.

646
00:25:23,333 --> 00:25:25,833
The Ministry of Education has strict regulations

647
00:25:26,500 --> 00:25:28,466
So you know why you can't do multiple choice questions and

648
00:25:28,466 --> 00:25:30,000
Filler question?

649
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:32,566
Because fill-in questions and multiple-choice questions have standard answers.

650
00:25:32,566 --> 00:25:34,133
If he writes every question wrong

651
00:25:34,133 --> 00:25:35,100
That's 0 points

652
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:36,933
If you score 0 points, you will not be admitted.

653
00:25:36,933 --> 00:25:38,766
So you must ask questions

654
00:25:38,766 --> 00:25:40,466
He just wrote two words

655
00:25:40,866 --> 00:25:43,033
The teacher is very handsome

656
00:25:43,133 --> 00:25:46,300
Give him another 10 points and he will be admitted.

657
00:25:46,300 --> 00:25:50,033
Well, after he comes in

658
00:25:50,966 --> 00:25:54,566
I said I wanted to talk about the first batch of graduate students

659
00:25:54,566 --> 00:25:57,233
He doesn't know anything when he comes in

660
00:25:57,366 --> 00:25:59,566
Never learned C code

661
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,100
Stop talking about Verilog

662
00:26:02,266 --> 00:26:04,900
I asked him to read a paper

663
00:26:04,900 --> 00:26:06,966
He looked it up from the first word to the last

664
00:26:06,966 --> 00:26:08,266
I don't know how to see it either

665
00:26:08,666 --> 00:26:11,766
Not from beginning to end

666
00:26:11,933 --> 00:26:14,066
Then I want to say that this is not possible

667
00:26:14,066 --> 00:26:17,100
Because he has to practice English well

668
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:18,733
He won't graduate in two years

669
00:26:18,733 --> 00:26:20,000
Just practice English

670
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:20,800
because

671
00:26:21,266 --> 00:26:22,833
you know that english

672
00:26:23,166 --> 00:26:26,033
How strong is English? Let me give you an example.

673
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:29,433
Is S-E-T set correct?

674
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:32,366
If you see a set of

675
00:26:32,900 --> 00:26:33,666
you will think

676
00:26:33,666 --> 00:26:36,000
It should be about something in a group

677
00:26:37,666 --> 00:26:39,766
But you know the word for this set

678
00:26:39,766 --> 00:26:41,333
sucks

679
00:26:41,333 --> 00:26:43,000
set may be a setting

680
00:26:43,066 --> 00:26:44,766
It may be a collection

681
00:26:44,766 --> 00:26:48,100
There are many possible meanings.

682
00:26:48,466 --> 00:26:50,366
Then he has never read the original document.

683
00:26:50,366 --> 00:26:50,900
do you know

684
00:26:50,900 --> 00:26:52,200
He saw a set of

685
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:55,333
He just randomly picked one from 20 possibilities.

686
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,500
translate him

687
00:26:56,500 --> 00:26:57,500
Then I will say

688
00:26:57,500 --> 00:26:59,566
How can you understand this paper?

689
00:26:59,566 --> 00:27:00,566
Impossible

690
00:27:00,566 --> 00:27:02,166
Because he looked up every word

691
00:27:02,166 --> 00:27:03,600
Then it goes around and around like this

692
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:04,766
Just like this

693
00:27:04,766 --> 00:27:06,400
Because he has never read the original document

694
00:27:07,133 --> 00:27:08,566
so

695
00:27:09,400 --> 00:27:12,066
There is no such thing as that

696
00:27:12,200 --> 00:27:13,200
Then I don't know what to do

697
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:14,666
I said there are only two things

698
00:27:14,666 --> 00:27:16,900
You just need to do two things

699
00:27:16,966 --> 00:27:19,366
In fact, he still has classmates who graduated in two years

700
00:27:19,366 --> 00:27:20,800
I said you only need to do two things

701
00:27:20,800 --> 00:27:22,066
The first one is to learn c code well

702
00:27:25,600 --> 00:27:26,800
Just simple c

703
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:28,600
Then he won't

704
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,633
Okay, trace the program that teacher wrote before

705
00:27:30,766 --> 00:27:32,766
If you don't know how, I'll teach you

706
00:27:33,166 --> 00:27:35,300
Ok then Verilog looks like this

707
00:27:35,366 --> 00:27:37,733
Just took my course

708
00:27:37,733 --> 00:27:39,500
I started writing this after finishing it

709
00:27:39,766 --> 00:27:41,966
That is to write well

710
00:27:43,800 --> 00:27:45,133
What about after you finish writing?

711
00:27:45,133 --> 00:27:46,133
He graduated in two years

712
00:27:46,133 --> 00:27:48,566
Then when I went out to work, I was actually very pitiful.

713
00:27:48,566 --> 00:27:50,266
Because his English is bad

714
00:27:50,266 --> 00:27:52,400
In fact, until he went to work, he

715
00:27:52,400 --> 00:27:54,600
He feels that he is very pitiful

716
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:57,066
So colleagues write e-mails in English

717
00:27:57,066 --> 00:28:00,166
He didn't dare to go back. He said he was coming to find me.

718
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:04,400
So that's English is so bad

719
00:28:04,700 --> 00:28:05,933
What will happen then?

720
00:28:05,933 --> 00:28:07,900
In fact, in my laboratory, that is learning

721
00:28:07,900 --> 00:28:09,800
I said your English is so bad

722
00:28:09,800 --> 00:28:11,900
It is impossible to write an English e-mail

723
00:28:11,966 --> 00:28:13,600
You just need to do one thing.

724
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:15,066
Understand the error message

725
00:28:15,500 --> 00:28:17,666
Do you want to check your error message?

726
00:28:17,733 --> 00:28:20,500
When you debug today, throw in the Verilog code.

727
00:28:20,500 --> 00:28:22,066
He will give error message

728
00:28:22,066 --> 00:28:24,133
Now you should read the error message often

729
00:28:24,133 --> 00:28:25,566
Then you have to understand

730
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,766
At least he can understand the error message and debug it.

731
00:28:29,933 --> 00:28:32,900
With one move, he entered the world of martial arts.

732
00:28:32,900 --> 00:28:34,566
Then I will say that time

733
00:28:34,566 --> 00:28:36,133
In fact, about twenty years ago

734
00:28:36,133 --> 00:28:38,200
Then I told him to go

735
00:28:38,466 --> 00:28:40,466
Hsinchu Science Park because we need to do IC design

736
00:28:40,466 --> 00:28:41,333
Only go to Hsinchu Science Park

737
00:28:41,333 --> 00:28:42,533
There are more job opportunities

738
00:28:42,533 --> 00:28:43,833
He only went in once

739
00:28:44,533 --> 00:28:46,300
When he entered VIA

740
00:28:46,466 --> 00:28:47,333
Because he will come back

741
00:28:47,333 --> 00:28:49,266
He often comes back to me and says: Teacher

742
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,366
beside

743
00:28:50,366 --> 00:28:52,300
What national university is it from?

744
00:28:52,300 --> 00:28:53,500
A lot of pressure

745
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:55,700
I said it doesn't matter, just do it well

746
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:57,666
Just do whatever people tell you to do

747
00:28:57,966 --> 00:28:59,300
So he is in VIA

748
00:28:59,300 --> 00:29:02,300
At that time, actually before VIA

749
00:29:02,300 --> 00:29:04,666
Thirty years ago, VIA was now MediaTek.

750
00:29:04,666 --> 00:29:06,666
You may not know

751
00:29:06,766 --> 00:29:09,300
VIA used to make that computer chip

752
00:29:13,566 --> 00:29:15,533
Now MediaTek

753
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:16,800
more than thirty years ago

754
00:29:16,800 --> 00:29:18,500
But 20 years ago when my students went

755
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,700
This is already the case

756
00:29:19,700 --> 00:29:20,666
His Vision

757
00:29:21,166 --> 00:29:25,566
It’s already very bad. The annual salary is about 100.

758
00:29:25,733 --> 00:29:28,300
Probably close to 100 or so

759
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:31,900
Then why does he even accept private schools?

760
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:34,333
It was over there before

761
00:29:34,333 --> 00:29:35,333
Finally survived

762
00:29:35,333 --> 00:29:38,366
But actually he has a principle

763
00:29:38,366 --> 00:29:40,666
Then it's possible that he turned out to be an elevator worker

764
00:29:40,666 --> 00:29:41,466
Have you worked hard

765
00:29:41,466 --> 00:29:42,600
He will feel that

766
00:29:42,800 --> 00:29:45,066
Be serious

767
00:29:45,066 --> 00:29:47,366
He gets off work at 10 o'clock, otherwise he gets off work at 11 o'clock

768
00:29:47,366 --> 00:29:49,233
I think so

769
00:29:49,366 --> 00:29:51,366
More tolerant

770
00:29:51,366 --> 00:29:53,566
That means you concentrate on it

771
00:29:54,266 --> 00:29:59,866
Later he went to VIA

772
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,900
VIA has been doing this for five or six years

773
00:30:01,900 --> 00:30:05,300
Then his boss happened to jump in

774
00:30:05,300 --> 00:30:06,233
Other companies

775
00:30:06,666 --> 00:30:09,800
Then there happened to be a shortage in the past few years.

776
00:30:09,800 --> 00:30:11,233
Then asked him if he wanted to go

777
00:30:11,266 --> 00:30:13,100
He went to the new company

778
00:30:14,133 --> 00:30:17,333
That company was the second largest in Taiwan at that time.

779
00:30:17,333 --> 00:30:19,166
At that time, MediaTek was the largest

780
00:30:19,166 --> 00:30:21,900
The second largest is the morning glow

781
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:24,800
In fact, when he jumped, I guess

782
00:30:24,800 --> 00:30:27,766
Because he is a student, we can't ask too detailed questions.

783
00:30:27,766 --> 00:30:28,400
I guess

784
00:30:28,400 --> 00:30:31,033
At that time, his signing bonus should have been 3 million.

785
00:30:31,866 --> 00:30:33,866
But he really used to be an elevator worker

786
00:30:33,866 --> 00:30:36,100
This is what he told me himself

787
00:30:36,100 --> 00:30:37,366
24 hours on call

788
00:30:37,566 --> 00:30:40,000
At that time, the signing bonus was 3 million

789
00:30:40,000 --> 00:30:43,600
Then drive one

790
00:30:44,700 --> 00:30:46,766
volvo RV

791
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:48,100
Come back to me

792
00:30:48,400 --> 00:30:50,333
Okay, let's go to Chenxi.

793
00:30:50,333 --> 00:30:52,266
Later, Mo Chenxi was acquired by MediaTek

794
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:53,633
Later he was at MediaTek

795
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:58,000
So actually this matter

796
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:58,766
Just want

797
00:30:58,766 --> 00:31:02,366
I like to use this example to encourage everyone

798
00:31:02,366 --> 00:31:06,100
Then as long as you are willing to take the time

799
00:31:06,100 --> 00:31:08,066
Then go get this done

800
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,166
because of this

801
00:31:09,166 --> 00:31:11,300
There is actually quite a shortage of people in this field.

802
00:31:11,300 --> 00:31:12,966
The field of IC design

803
00:31:13,333 --> 00:31:17,066
What he's afraid of is that you don't want to spend that time

804
00:31:17,066 --> 00:31:19,666
As long as you are willing to take the time to learn it well

805
00:31:19,800 --> 00:31:22,333
In fact, your future

806
00:31:22,333 --> 00:31:24,000
Actually, to put it more plainly, this kind of thing

807
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:26,966
This kind of salary can't be worse than that of a doctor

808
00:31:26,966 --> 00:31:28,633
because of you

809
00:31:28,666 --> 00:31:30,233
Because there used to be many

810
00:31:30,266 --> 00:31:33,366
Parents or students will want to study as a doctor

811
00:31:33,566 --> 00:31:35,300
That doctor actually works very hard.

812
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:37,300
Have to be on duty at night or something?

813
00:31:37,300 --> 00:31:38,900
Often have to stay awake

814
00:31:38,900 --> 00:31:39,566
What what

815
00:31:39,566 --> 00:31:42,366
What are you doing without sleeping for 36 hours straight?

816
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,366
And what about covid-19 now?

817
00:31:45,366 --> 00:31:46,900
What SARS

818
00:31:47,066 --> 00:31:50,733
It's easy to get hurt easily. It's easy to get shot.

819
00:31:50,733 --> 00:31:53,566
Right? But I think engineers are

820
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:56,833
As long as you do it well, it will be relatively safe.

821
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,400
So I still have to encourage you

822
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:01,533
So wait a moment and let’s talk about it like this

823
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:03,866
During the midterm exam, do you really want to

824
00:32:04,366 --> 00:32:05,966
Listen very carefully

825
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:09,066
Because if you don’t do well in the midterm exam

826
00:32:09,066 --> 00:32:11,200
If you have any questions, please ask the teaching assistant.

827
00:32:11,200 --> 00:32:13,766
Then when you go back, write it yourself

828
00:32:13,900 --> 00:32:16,666
Good because we have adjusted the time

829
00:32:16,666 --> 00:32:19,266
So you can imagine after we finish today

830
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:20,533
Today is April 20th

831
00:32:20,533 --> 00:32:22,900
We will have final exams at the end of May

832
00:32:23,500 --> 00:32:25,200
Okay so you have a month left

833
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,300
Can strengthen your Verilog

834
00:32:27,300 --> 00:32:28,666
If you Verilog

835
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:30,733
I didn’t write my previous homework seriously

836
00:32:30,733 --> 00:32:33,200
You have one month left to strengthen

837
00:32:33,200 --> 00:32:35,200
Then you should work hard this month

838
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:36,000
Then you

839
00:32:36,000 --> 00:32:38,833
We have finished the final exam and have final homework

840
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:42,333
That still encourages everyone

841
00:32:42,333 --> 00:32:43,500
as long as you take the time

842
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:46,366
You should gain something in the end

843
00:32:46,566 --> 00:32:49,900
What I'm afraid of is that you don't take the time

844
00:32:50,866 --> 00:32:54,800
Then let's go down, so

845
00:32:56,200 --> 00:32:59,300
resource optimization

846
00:32:59,300 --> 00:33:03,000
resource optimization you except these two

847
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,400
In addition to storage space and functional sharing

848
00:33:06,400 --> 00:33:09,433
Another thing you can do is bus sharing.

849
00:33:09,500 --> 00:33:11,966
What is bus sharing?

850
00:33:11,966 --> 00:33:13,266
That is

851
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,066
Bus Sharing

852
00:33:15,066 --> 00:33:17,133
Then why do we need to share the bus?

853
00:33:17,133 --> 00:33:18,433
because you can see

854
00:33:18,800 --> 00:33:20,000
Look there's a lot of wiring here

855
00:33:20,000 --> 00:33:21,600
We have just arrived at this

856
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:24,000
Are the three temporary registers correct?

857
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,800
We just need 3 temporary registers and then what?

858
00:33:26,933 --> 00:33:29,566
Are the two arithmetic units right? OK

859
00:33:29,566 --> 00:33:31,800
We've streamlined it to this

860
00:33:31,800 --> 00:33:34,033
Or it can be both

861
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,033
Three scratchpads and then two arithmetic units

862
00:33:39,766 --> 00:33:42,600
We've streamlined it down to this, okay

863
00:33:42,600 --> 00:33:44,566
So what else can be streamlined now?

864
00:33:44,566 --> 00:33:46,300
These wiring problems

865
00:33:50,100 --> 00:33:52,500
These lines are actually quite messy.

866
00:33:52,500 --> 00:33:55,200
Then if each register is 32bit

867
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:56,066
did you know

868
00:33:56,066 --> 00:33:58,700
This is connected to 32bit, 32bit

869
00:33:58,700 --> 00:34:00,266
This is because this is just drawing a line

870
00:34:00,266 --> 00:34:00,700
But

871
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:03,566
If it is 32bit, he will have 32 at the same time

872
00:34:03,566 --> 00:34:05,366
Then this one too

873
00:34:05,366 --> 00:34:06,100
so what

874
00:34:06,100 --> 00:34:10,300
Is there any way we can use a concept like a bus

875
00:34:10,300 --> 00:34:12,600
Because our next step is bus sharing

876
00:34:12,600 --> 00:34:16,866
It's like a bus, shared by everyone

877
00:34:16,866 --> 00:34:18,966
bus concept

878
00:34:19,333 --> 00:34:22,166
What about line sharing?

879
00:34:22,400 --> 00:34:23,566
a bit like saying

880
00:34:23,566 --> 00:34:26,300
It will be cleaner if you tidy up that line.

881
00:34:26,300 --> 00:34:28,166
This is the concept of the whole line

882
00:34:28,566 --> 00:34:31,000
I hope I can tidy up my line

883
00:34:31,000 --> 00:34:32,966
Then he will be cleaner

884
00:34:32,966 --> 00:34:36,066
Then this is called bus sharing

885
00:34:36,066 --> 00:34:37,800
Then you want to reorganize the line?

886
00:34:37,800 --> 00:34:40,100
Still the same came

887
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,000
This is the purpose of bus

888
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:44,933
For example, busbar. We know busbar

889
00:34:44,933 --> 00:34:46,066
that is

890
00:34:46,933 --> 00:34:49,600
You need to transfer the data from here to here

891
00:34:49,600 --> 00:34:52,666
Then I can connect this bus

892
00:34:52,666 --> 00:34:54,266
Everyone shares this cable

893
00:34:54,266 --> 00:34:56,400
Then you can pick it up too

894
00:34:56,400 --> 00:34:58,300
Then he can pick it up too

895
00:34:58,300 --> 00:35:00,500
Everyone can connect to this bus

896
00:35:00,500 --> 00:35:02,466
It's good without a problem

897
00:35:02,466 --> 00:35:03,966
But here comes the problem

898
00:35:04,066 --> 00:35:07,500
If student a is saving information,

899
00:35:07,800 --> 00:35:09,400
I will upload it again

900
00:35:09,400 --> 00:35:12,033
Then classmate C uploaded the message. No.

901
00:35:12,333 --> 00:35:14,400
because of a bus

902
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:15,700
add a line

903
00:35:15,700 --> 00:35:17,666
Someone above passed it on

904
00:35:18,133 --> 00:35:20,366
When that person passes it, no one else can pass it.

905
00:35:20,666 --> 00:35:22,566
Right? So the concept of busbar

906
00:35:22,566 --> 00:35:23,933
It is shared by everyone

907
00:35:23,933 --> 00:35:27,633
Just like the concept of bus bus means

908
00:35:28,700 --> 00:35:32,466
For example, I drove from Tainan High Speed ​​Rail Station to

909
00:35:32,866 --> 00:35:34,700
Tainan City National Cheng Kung University

910
00:35:34,700 --> 00:35:38,000
Then the concept of my bus is to share the fare with everyone.

911
00:35:39,466 --> 00:35:40,466
right?

912
00:35:41,366 --> 00:35:45,800
It costs me NT$3,000 to drive from Tainan High Speed ​​Rail to National Cheng Kung University

913
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:48,500
Everyone who comes up shares it.

914
00:35:48,500 --> 00:35:49,666
Pay this money together

915
00:35:49,666 --> 00:35:52,566
Then everyone will pay less

916
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:54,000
The concept of bus sharing is this

917
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,066
If everyone shares this bus

918
00:35:56,066 --> 00:35:58,600
Now the cost is lower

919
00:35:58,600 --> 00:35:59,900
But it is shared

920
00:36:00,066 --> 00:36:02,100
But there is a problem with sharing

921
00:36:02,266 --> 00:36:04,933
When classmate a threw the information up,

922
00:36:04,933 --> 00:36:07,300
Classmate b cannot throw it away. Classmate c cannot throw it away.

923
00:36:07,300 --> 00:36:10,966
Because only one person can drop one line at a time

924
00:36:10,966 --> 00:36:13,200
That is, there can only be one per line

925
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:14,466
In other words, look

926
00:36:14,466 --> 00:36:15,800
That means this

927
00:36:16,333 --> 00:36:18,333
If we all share a line

928
00:36:18,333 --> 00:36:21,900
This person loses 101

929
00:36:21,900 --> 00:36:22,900
Then I can't lose it

930
00:36:22,900 --> 00:36:26,366
Because otherwise if he loses 101, then I lose 010

931
00:36:26,366 --> 00:36:29,000
Then on this line you lose 0 and I lose 1

932
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:32,100
So is this line 0 or 1?

933
00:36:32,166 --> 00:36:33,700
I have no idea

934
00:36:33,700 --> 00:36:36,300
So the bus concept means

935
00:36:36,566 --> 00:36:37,733
I don’t use it when you use it.

936
00:36:37,733 --> 00:36:39,733
You don’t have to be nice when I use it

937
00:36:39,733 --> 00:36:40,600
Then you see

938
00:36:40,600 --> 00:36:41,766
Ours

939
00:36:42,266 --> 00:36:44,400
I can straighten out the title

940
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:47,366
Using the bus concept I can wire it into

941
00:36:47,666 --> 00:36:48,666
like this

942
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,700
Look, it will be very clean here.

943
00:36:51,700 --> 00:36:54,200
It's not like this just now. It was a mess here just now.

944
00:36:54,400 --> 00:36:57,133
Now I'll line it up like this, okay

945
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:58,566
But when it's like this

946
00:36:58,566 --> 00:37:00,300
What should we pay attention to

947
00:37:03,466 --> 00:37:05,233
For example bus1

948
00:37:05,900 --> 00:37:08,100
R1 is connected to bus1

949
00:37:08,266 --> 00:37:10,666
What does it mean when r3 is connected to bus1?

950
00:37:11,500 --> 00:37:15,833
r3 cannot be used when r1 is using bus1

951
00:37:16,666 --> 00:37:18,300
When using r3

952
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:19,900
r1 cannot be used

953
00:37:19,900 --> 00:37:21,466
Because only one person can use it

954
00:37:21,466 --> 00:37:23,966
Because the concept of this bus is like this

955
00:37:23,966 --> 00:37:25,866
I don’t use it when you use it.

956
00:37:25,866 --> 00:37:27,833
I don’t use it when others use it.

957
00:37:29,400 --> 00:37:31,533
Well that's it

958
00:37:31,533 --> 00:37:36,000
Then you have bus1, bus2, bus2 connected to r2

959
00:37:36,100 --> 00:37:40,566
Then down below, you still have bus3, and the same goes for bus4.

960
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:45,600
You see there are two people in bus3

961
00:37:45,600 --> 00:37:46,900
you can throw

962
00:37:46,933 --> 00:37:48,000
I can also throw it away

963
00:37:48,066 --> 00:37:50,266
Then I won’t throw it away when you throw it away.

964
00:37:50,366 --> 00:37:52,166
When I throw it, you don’t throw it away.

965
00:37:52,866 --> 00:37:54,566
Well, this is the concept of bus

966
00:37:54,566 --> 00:37:56,866
So the bus is basically a bit like this

967
00:37:56,866 --> 00:38:01,000
Actually, this is a bus connection

968
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:03,200
He just uses one

969
00:38:03,333 --> 00:38:05,766
tri-state gate

970
00:38:05,766 --> 00:38:09,233
What can a tri-state gate do? You see, it is actually

971
00:38:09,600 --> 00:38:13,200
Your value is connected to mine.

972
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:14,966
Everyone has received this line

973
00:38:15,100 --> 00:38:17,866
But I have a control

974
00:38:17,866 --> 00:38:20,300
I used a tri-state gate here

975
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,766
I can control when I say you are okay and I am not okay

976
00:38:25,066 --> 00:38:27,200
When I can get through, you can’t.

977
00:38:27,200 --> 00:38:28,400
That's because he is

978
00:38:28,400 --> 00:38:30,866
If enable comes, it will pass

979
00:38:30,933 --> 00:38:34,500
enable did not come, I regarded it as high impedance

980
00:38:34,500 --> 00:38:36,766
That high impedance is a bit like an open circuit

981
00:38:36,766 --> 00:38:37,933
That is to say, I enable

982
00:38:37,933 --> 00:38:39,800
He always knows when he comes

983
00:38:39,866 --> 00:38:42,100
You can throw the data into this bus

984
00:38:42,300 --> 00:38:44,600
If enable is not turned on, it will become high impedance.

985
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:45,366
High impedance

986
00:38:45,366 --> 00:38:46,733
It's like a broken circuit

987
00:38:46,733 --> 00:38:48,900
It means our line is broken

988
00:38:48,900 --> 00:38:50,100
What does this mean?

989
00:38:50,100 --> 00:38:52,600
The two of us need to use this bus

990
00:38:52,866 --> 00:38:54,266
Then I will control it here.

991
00:38:54,266 --> 00:38:55,600
Either you or I can understand

992
00:38:55,600 --> 00:38:57,933
So when you pass

993
00:38:57,933 --> 00:38:59,600
Your value can come over

994
00:38:59,766 --> 00:39:01,800
Then my side will be disconnected.

995
00:39:01,800 --> 00:39:03,500
High impedance is a bit like an open circuit

996
00:39:03,500 --> 00:39:05,266
So my value won’t come over

997
00:39:05,466 --> 00:39:08,700
Just wait until I get through. It will be through me.

998
00:39:08,700 --> 00:39:10,533
Then your side will have high impedance

999
00:39:10,533 --> 00:39:12,666
like you are a disconnect

1000
00:39:12,666 --> 00:39:14,600
Then use this to ensure that

1001
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:16,466
We only have one person

1002
00:39:17,000 --> 00:39:18,266
good

1003
00:39:18,266 --> 00:39:21,200
So if we take the topic we just asked

1004
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:22,733
How do we do this?

1005
00:39:22,733 --> 00:39:24,200
Okay, let's take a look

1006
00:39:24,266 --> 00:39:25,866
You just did this

1007
00:39:27,000 --> 00:39:29,300
Okay, then I'm going to start reorganizing the line now.

1008
00:39:29,366 --> 00:39:32,133
I want to use the bus concept

1009
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:34,400
Then what if I use the bus concept?

1010
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:35,466
well

1011
00:39:35,466 --> 00:39:36,800
Then let's assume

1012
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,600
We assume this is the case

1013
00:39:38,600 --> 00:39:42,566
Your r1 is A, t1, x, t7

1014
00:39:42,566 --> 00:39:48,300
r2 is B, t2, y, t3, t5, t6

1015
00:39:48,700 --> 00:39:50,500
R3 is equipped with T4

1016
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:52,333
Just based on these variable assumptions

1017
00:39:52,333 --> 00:39:53,733
This is what we put

1018
00:39:53,733 --> 00:39:55,266
This is our premise

1019
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:57,766
And then you now have these two pieces of hardware

1020
00:39:57,766 --> 00:40:00,366
Okay, now I'm going to start reorganizing the line.

1021
00:40:00,666 --> 00:40:01,466
well

1022
00:40:01,466 --> 00:40:03,666
I'm going to start reorganizing the line, okay?

1023
00:40:03,666 --> 00:40:05,400
Then let me ask everyone

1024
00:40:05,400 --> 00:40:07,833
Now I assume there is a bus

1025
00:40:07,966 --> 00:40:09,700
Can I

1026
00:40:09,800 --> 00:40:11,900
Take r1 and r2 and connect them to this bus.

1027
00:40:13,366 --> 00:40:15,566
No, no

1028
00:40:15,566 --> 00:40:18,500
No, because r1 stores a

1029
00:40:19,533 --> 00:40:20,800
r2 stores b

1030
00:40:21,166 --> 00:40:22,700
I'm in this state

1031
00:40:23,666 --> 00:40:26,866
I will read out a at the same time

1032
00:40:26,933 --> 00:40:28,400
At the same time, read out b

1033
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:30,066
Because I want to calculate his absolute value

1034
00:40:30,966 --> 00:40:34,200
Right? So I'm in r1

1035
00:40:34,200 --> 00:40:36,766
When I'm in this state

1036
00:40:37,000 --> 00:40:39,633
I want to read a and b at the same time

1037
00:40:41,300 --> 00:40:46,233
One is placed in r1 and the other is placed in r2.

1038
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:49,066
So you must use two different buses

1039
00:40:49,066 --> 00:40:51,400
This way I can read a and b at the same time

1040
00:40:51,733 --> 00:40:53,200
Okay, so you watch out.

1041
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:56,266
The bus you come out of is r1 and use bus1.

1042
00:40:56,666 --> 00:40:59,266
R2 is better with bus2

1043
00:40:59,300 --> 00:41:01,400
Then our doubt now is

1044
00:41:01,400 --> 00:41:02,600
then why do you

1045
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:06,600
r3 and r1 will use the same bus

1046
00:41:07,300 --> 00:41:11,466
r3 and r1 will use the same bus

1047
00:41:11,733 --> 00:41:13,400
it's because you see

1048
00:41:13,500 --> 00:41:16,200
Is your r3 equipped with T4?

1049
00:41:16,533 --> 00:41:19,566
When your T4 is blocked

1050
00:41:19,566 --> 00:41:21,300
You need to block the other one

1051
00:41:21,300 --> 00:41:23,133
When t4 is taken out for calculation

1052
00:41:23,133 --> 00:41:25,066
This way

1053
00:41:25,266 --> 00:41:26,700
There is t4 here

1054
00:41:27,700 --> 00:41:30,300
Then the other thing to do is T5

1055
00:41:30,300 --> 00:41:31,666
Where is T5 placed?

1056
00:41:32,366 --> 00:41:32,733
r2

1057
00:41:32,733 --> 00:41:36,366
So you see these two moving like this at the same time

1058
00:41:36,366 --> 00:41:37,500
Then you r3

1059
00:41:37,500 --> 00:41:39,400
when moving

1060
00:41:39,533 --> 00:41:42,300
When r3 moves, your r1 will not actually move.

1061
00:41:42,300 --> 00:41:43,766
When your t4 moves

1062
00:41:43,900 --> 00:41:46,200
All r1 can move

1063
00:41:46,500 --> 00:41:50,600
So you can use two buses smoothly

1064
00:41:50,600 --> 00:41:52,566
Then why can these two be merged?

1065
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:56,100
Why aren't r1 and r2 on the same bus?

1066
00:41:56,366 --> 00:41:58,400
It's because they are at the same time

1067
00:41:58,466 --> 00:42:00,633
Then r1 and r3 can

1068
00:42:00,933 --> 00:42:02,533
It's because

1069
00:42:02,533 --> 00:42:05,566
When I was studying T4

1070
00:42:05,566 --> 00:42:06,600
r1 will not move

1071
00:42:06,600 --> 00:42:08,566
Then when my r1 is moving

1072
00:42:08,966 --> 00:42:11,400
r3 will not move

1073
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:13,466
So his line will

1074
00:42:13,466 --> 00:42:15,033
I can put it together

1075
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,833
That's the same reason

1076
00:42:16,933 --> 00:42:18,900
Check here too

1077
00:42:18,900 --> 00:42:20,800
Why this bus3

1078
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:23,200
This one will receive this

1079
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:25,200
It must be something

1080
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:29,000
It’s just that these three people will never move at the same time.

1081
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:30,700
There must be only one person moving

1082
00:42:30,700 --> 00:42:32,900
Only one of these three people moved

1083
00:42:32,900 --> 00:42:34,900
What about these three people?

1084
00:42:35,066 --> 00:42:36,300
Why are they connected together?

1085
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:38,900
Because this person won't move when he moves.

1086
00:42:38,900 --> 00:42:40,866
This guy won't move when he moves.

1087
00:42:41,166 --> 00:42:44,466
Okay, but let's not move here at the same time.

1088
00:42:44,466 --> 00:42:45,833
It can be so good

1089
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:50,100
So this bus sharing is actually the same concept.

1090
00:42:50,866 --> 00:42:53,366
For the three sharings, you can think about why

1091
00:42:53,366 --> 00:42:54,566
The concept is the same

1092
00:42:54,566 --> 00:42:55,366
you

1093
00:42:55,366 --> 00:42:57,366
When you use it, I can't use it, it must be like this

1094
00:42:57,366 --> 00:42:59,066
Because that’s what sharing is

1095
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,266
Sharing

1096
00:43:02,300 --> 00:43:04,233
Why are temporary registers shared?

1097
00:43:04,500 --> 00:43:06,400
When you save, I won’t save.

1098
00:43:06,400 --> 00:43:08,366
When I save, you don’t save.

1099
00:43:08,866 --> 00:43:11,766
Right, so the life spans cannot overlap?

1100
00:43:11,766 --> 00:43:13,300
Assume that it was all my fault

1101
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:14,800
Then wait until I don't need to go out

1102
00:43:14,800 --> 00:43:16,366
I'll give you the space

1103
00:43:16,366 --> 00:43:18,566
This is called storage sharing

1104
00:43:18,566 --> 00:43:20,966
The same goes for functional unit sharing

1105
00:43:21,733 --> 00:43:24,733
If you don't do these two operations at the same time,

1106
00:43:24,733 --> 00:43:26,266
I don't do it when you do it

1107
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,866
You don't do it when I do it

1108
00:43:27,866 --> 00:43:29,800
Then you can do it together

1109
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,166
Shared hardware

1110
00:43:31,366 --> 00:43:34,766
to achieve the goal of cost reduction

1111
00:43:34,766 --> 00:43:36,666
The same goes for bus sharing

1112
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:38,500
I won’t pass it on when you pass it on

1113
00:43:38,500 --> 00:43:40,500
When I pass it on, you don’t pass it on

1114
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:43,033
Then the two of us can share a bus.

1115
00:43:43,466 --> 00:43:45,733
Okay, if we both want to pass it on too

1116
00:43:45,733 --> 00:43:48,133
Then I will use two buses.

1117
00:43:48,133 --> 00:43:49,766
Just like this, okay

1118
00:43:51,600 --> 00:43:53,600
When r1 passes, r2 also has to go.

1119
00:43:53,600 --> 00:43:55,666
Then the two of us need to use different buses.

1120
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:56,900
but

1121
00:43:56,900 --> 00:43:59,066
After the information of r1 is released, r3 will not be released.

1122
00:43:59,066 --> 00:44:00,566
When r3 comes out, r1 will not come out.

1123
00:44:00,566 --> 00:44:03,566
Then we can share a bus

1124
00:44:03,566 --> 00:44:06,500
I can make my lines leaner

1125
00:44:06,500 --> 00:44:08,200
And you can

1126
00:44:08,533 --> 00:44:09,700
The planning is better

1127
00:44:09,700 --> 00:44:11,366
but still the same

1128
00:44:11,666 --> 00:44:12,300
I'll tell you

1129
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:15,066
Each of these is very troublesome to do.

1130
00:44:15,066 --> 00:44:17,133
123 Good

1131
00:44:17,133 --> 00:44:19,766
Even to the last Register

1132
00:44:19,766 --> 00:44:21,466
Same thing

1133
00:44:21,466 --> 00:44:24,000
The same is true for Register merging

1134
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:26,733
It will make your circuit very complicated

1135
00:44:26,733 --> 00:44:28,666
So basically

1136
00:44:28,666 --> 00:44:29,700
our

1137
00:44:30,333 --> 00:44:32,666
Most probably won't use it

1138
00:44:32,666 --> 00:44:35,100
That is, at least these two will definitely not

1139
00:44:35,100 --> 00:44:36,733
Then I will tell you about this.

1140
00:44:36,733 --> 00:44:39,800
Large-scale functional unit sharing is possible

1141
00:44:39,800 --> 00:44:42,166
You just have to pay attention when you compete.

1142
00:44:42,166 --> 00:44:45,166
If there is a large functional unit

1143
00:44:45,266 --> 00:44:47,200
Or a relatively big topic

1144
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,100
Maybe you should pay attention to it

1145
00:44:49,100 --> 00:44:50,066
Otherwise

1146
00:44:50,066 --> 00:44:52,000
In fact, because after using it

1147
00:44:52,000 --> 00:44:53,966
will make your circuit design become

1148
00:44:53,966 --> 00:44:57,366
Very very complicated

1149
00:44:57,366 --> 00:45:00,433
So in principle, today we will

1150
00:45:00,733 --> 00:45:05,466
After talking about the previous resource sharing 123 3

1151
00:45:06,700 --> 00:45:08,700
Sharing of constituent units

1152
00:45:08,700 --> 00:45:11,366
Sharing of the third computing unit

1153
00:45:11,366 --> 00:45:13,333
and bus sharing

1154
00:45:13,333 --> 00:45:15,000
Then the remaining unit

1155
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:17,466
We’ll talk about this next week

1156
00:45:17,466 --> 00:45:20,233
Then in the next class I will

1157
00:45:20,466 --> 00:45:21,733
Give time to teaching assistants

1158
00:45:21,733 --> 00:45:24,966
He will come and give the fourth assignment

1159
00:45:24,966 --> 00:45:26,766
That's because I have to give him a whole class

1160
00:45:26,766 --> 00:45:29,700
Because he still has to review the midterm exam

1161
00:45:29,700 --> 00:45:33,666
So I left get out of class two minutes early

1162
00:45:33,866 --> 00:45:36,566
If you forget the questions for the midterm exam

1163
00:45:36,566 --> 00:45:38,933
Please review it quickly

1164
00:45:38,933 --> 00:45:41,466
Then wait until the assistant teacher comes to explain.

1165
00:45:41,466 --> 00:45:43,000
you will know better

1166
00:45:43,300 --> 00:45:46,400
Is his answer available in Moodle?

1167
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,700
Then take a quick look at it, okay?

1168
00:45:48,700 --> 00:45:51,466
Then he will explain it later, OK.

1169
00:45:51,466 --> 00:45:54,433
Then let’s finish class 2 minutes early for this period.
